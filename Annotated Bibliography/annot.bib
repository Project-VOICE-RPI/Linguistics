This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

This means that their brain is capable of this level of literacy and are already recognizing sentences and word meaning, so with adequate instruction it might be possible lead them to written forms of communication as an alternative to speech. }

The authors highlight the importance of user-centered design for these technologies, advocating for a focus on the user's needs and abilities in different communication contexts.}

The methods being compared and discussed in this paper are speech generating devices (SGD), mobile applications, picture exchange communication systems (PECS), AI/ML, and augmented reality (AR) based applications. The paper highlights the conveniences and inconveniences of each method detailed in various studies of each method, and explores the paradigm shift from traditional PECS methods to more AI/ML and AR based methods.}

People with PIMD tend to develop at a slow and unpredictable pace, making it notoriously hard to implement general AAC methods. The effectiveness of various AAC are also dependent on their environment: are the parents/caregivers competent in using the assistive technology? How would the patient communicate in an environment where the people around them may not be as competent, particularly in doing everyday tasks? Additionally, the types of AAC that may seem to be more efficient (i.e. visual scene displays) were reported to be less used compared to other, more "cognitively demanding" methods of communication.}

  annote    = { Immersive VR applications are growing increasingly popular within several fields of healthcare. For communication in particular, immersive VR environments may be a valid method for communication partners and the public to interact with those who have communication disabilities. The gamification of education can help to develop medical students' knowledge in medical interactions, and also interpersonal communication skills in general. However, it must be noted that VR environments, by being more immersive, can easily distort our perception of reality. It is important to be aware of how VR is representing certain demographics, cultures, and environments in general in order to not influence the users' intrinsic biases. There are also safety concerns when using VR for a prolonged period of time, such as motion sickness or "cyber sickness". }
