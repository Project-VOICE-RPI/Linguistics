This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

Researchers tested this system using four different machine learning algorithms and found that adding environmental data significantly improved the accuracy of classifying these movements into categories that could help with communication. The authors concluded that using machine learning in conjunction with environmental data holds promise for supporting communication and improving the quality of life for children with PIMD. Further investigation is needed to understand how the specific levels of these weather features relate to the children's behaviors.}

The authors analyzed 43 studies and identified four key findings: high user acceptance of avatar-based CAs, a need for more personalized and empathetic CAs, limited evidence of CAs' efficacy in NCD self-management despite optimism among healthcare professionals, and the predominant use of CAs for non-pharmacological interventions like lifestyle modifications.  The review concludes that AI-based CAs show promise for supporting self-management of chronic conditions but require further development and rigorous evaluation, particularly focusing on data privacy, patient safety, and efficacy in diverse populations and settings.}

How would the patient communicate in less supportive settings? Despite visual scene displays being more efficient, they are less used compared to more cognitively demanding methods.}

This phoneme-based method relies on the sound of the words rather than spelling, which is a more natural way of communication and therefore easier, but it’s not simplified to the point of using pictures since this method constricts their vocabulary too much. With phonemes, users can make their own words too and have an infinite number of word combinations. The interface is still somewhat complicated, though, and requires fine movement with their fingers, so many children with PIMD may be unable to use it. }
