  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

  annote    = { There are a variety of different methods currently employed to help with communication between people with ASD and general communicative disabilities, all considered under the AAC, or Augmented and Alternative methods of Communication. The methods being compared and discussed in this paper are speech generating devices (SGD), mobile applications, picture exchange communication systems (PECS), AI/ML, and augmented reality (AR) based applications. The paper highlights the conveniences and inconveniences of each method detailed in various studies of each method, and explores the paradigm shift from traditional PECS methods to more AI/ML and AR based methods.}

  annote    = { While speech language pathologists are generally highly receptive to and encouraging of assistive technology when dealing with patients with PIMD, the reality of its usage may be more complex. People with PIMD tend to develop at a slow and unpredictable pace, making it notoriously hard to implement general AAC methods. The effectiveness of various AAC are also dependent on their environment: are the parents/caregivers competent in using the assistive technology? How would the patient communicate in an environment where the people around them may not be as competent, particularly in doing everyday tasks? Additionally, the types of AAC that may seem to be more efficient (i.e. visual scene displays) were reported to be less used compared to other, more "cognitively demanding" methods of communication.}
