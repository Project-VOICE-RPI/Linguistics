  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

  annote    = { This paper explores the potential of eye gaze interactions as an accessible communication tool for nonspeaking autistic individuals within an Augmented Reality (AR) environment. Using the HoloLens 2, the authors developed HoloGaze, an eye gaze-based system that allows users to select targets either by fixating on them or using a combination of gaze and a physical button ("gaze-click"). The study highlights the promise of gaze-based AR systems while addressing the challenges and improvements needed for future use. Some improvements include better device calibrations and a bigger, more diverse participant pool. The study was only done with 14 participants, all being male. Overall, gaze-based interactions could offer a viable communication tool for nonspeaking autistic individuals.}

  annote    = { This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with assistive technologies (ATs) for autism, highlighting developments in AI-robotics and wearable devices, such as smart glasses, aimed at improving communication and social engagement for individuals with autism. There are also mobile apps that are AI-powered to provide more support. Currently, “researchers are prioritizing innovation over establishing a solid presence within the healthcare domain, where issues such as regulation and acceptance demand increased attention.” Challenges include the diverse needs within the autism spectrum, ethical concerns about privacy and data security, and the potential lack of human empathy in AI interventions.}

There are low-tech systems like PECS to high-tech devices such as tablets and virtual reality (VR). Each shows varying degrees of effectiveness. Techniques like TEACCH and PECS have had mixed results, responsive methods like RPMT have shown promise in improving communication and language skills. Tablets with apps like Proloquo2Go and speech-generating devices also have positive effects. Emerging VR technologies show potential for enhancing social communication but are still in early stages. Despite limitations in the studies, including small sample sizes, these findings emphasize the importance of personalized interventions to improve communication, social interaction, and development for children with ASD.}

CNNs are effective in capturing local patterns in spectro-temporal features for audio signal analysis. RNNs are effective at modeling time dependencies and recognizing subtle patterns in speech. There are gaps regarding Machine Learning which include a need for larger datasets, limitations in existing metrics, and user privacy and security.},

Participants rated the nodding virtual character much higher for maintaining eye contact and showing attention to what was being said. It helped enhance immersion. Participants were also more likely to approach a nodding virtual character than a non-nodding one. As for limitations, the authors suggest expanding participant demographics, refining nodding animations, and exploring VR applications in education.},

Among the gross motor skills associated with social skills, object control skills seemed most closely linked to the social skills.}

Both AS groups exhibited slightly faster visual processing than typically developing participants. The findings suggest that early language development may influence motor coordination.}

The analysis also showed that motor skills were predictive of adaptive behavior scores, with manual dexterity being specifically associated with adaptive behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing motor skill difficulties as a potential factor influencing adaptive behavior in autistic individuals.}

Using an iPad and a communication book, participants were taught to produce multisymbol messages during playtime. Results suggested that the modified PECS protocol effectively supports the transition to high-tech AAC systems.}
