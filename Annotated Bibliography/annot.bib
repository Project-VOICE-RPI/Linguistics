  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

  annote    = { This paper explores the potential of eye gaze interactions as an accessible communication tool for nonspeaking autistic individuals within an Augmented Reality (AR) environment. Using the HoloLens 2, the authors developed HoloGaze, an eye gaze-based system that allows users to select targets either by fixating on them or using a combination of gaze and a physical button ("gaze-click"). The study highlights the promise of gaze-based AR systems while addressing the challenges and improvements needed for future use.}
