  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

  annote    = { This paper explores the potential of eye gaze interactions as an accessible communication tool for nonspeaking autistic individuals within an Augmented Reality (AR) environment. Using the HoloLens 2, the authors developed HoloGaze, an eye gaze-based system that allows users to select targets either by fixating on them or using a combination of gaze and a physical button ("gaze-click"). The study highlights the promise of gaze-based AR systems while addressing the challenges and improvements needed for future use.}

  journal   = {Journal of Personalized Medicine},
  year      = {2023},
  volume    = {14},
  month     = {December},
  annote    = { This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with assistive technologies (ATs) for autism, highlighting developments in AI-robotics and wearable devices, such as smart glasses, aimed at improving communication and social engagement for individuals with autism. While the field shows promise, the emphasis on innovation currently outweighs the establishment of regulatory frameworks and healthcare integration. Challenges include the diverse needs within the autism spectrum, ethical concerns about privacy and data security, and the potential lack of human empathy in AI interventions. Moving forward, balancing technological advancements with ethical and practical considerations will be key in ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for neurodiverse individuals.}

  title     = {Instruments for augmentative and alternative communication for children with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review.},
  journal   = {Clinics},
  year      = {2018},
  month     = {November},
  annote    = { This review presents a thorough analysis of various instruments and technologies used to improve communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The reviewed studies show a range of approaches, from low-tech tools like the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) to high-tech devices like tablets and virtual reality (VR) systems, each with varying degrees of effectiveness. Techniques like TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children) and PECS are common interventions for children with ASD, aimed at enhancing communication, socialization, and self-care. While TEACCH has shown success in improving several domains, its impact on communication is still debated. Similarly, PECS has produced inconsistent outcomes, with some studies reporting long-term improvements, while others found no lasting effects after intervention. On the other hand, responsive techniques like RPMT (Responsive Education and Prelinguistic Milieu Teaching) have shown promise in fostering communication, joint attention, and language skills. Studies suggest that approaches focusing on joint attention are crucial in developing speech and social skills. Technological devices also play a crucial role in improving communication among children with ASD. Tablets with applications like Proloquo2Go™ and iCAN have shown positive effects on language and communication skills, providing an engaging medium for children. Additionally, devices like speech-generating devices (SGDs) and tools such as the vSked scheduling system contribute to reducing anxiety and improving communication by providing structured support in daily activities. Interestingly, emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) are gaining traction for their immersive and interactive potential. VR-based systems have demonstrated improvements in social communication and engagement, although their use is still in early stages. Limitations in the reviewed studies, such as small sample sizes and lack of validated tools, indicate the need for further research with larger and more diverse populations. Nonetheless, these findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions that can adapt to the individual needs and preferences of children with ASD, offering pathways for improving communication, social interaction, and overall development.}

They include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP), and Multi-nets Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). CNNs are effective in capturing local patterns in spectro-temporal features for audio signal analysis. RNNs are effective at modeling time dependencies and recognizing subtle patterns in speech. There are gaps regarding Machine Learning which include a need for larger datasets, limitations in existing metrics, and user privacy and security.},

  volume = {164},
  annote = {This paper explores how virtual humans' head-nodding behavior in VR affects participants’ perceptions of interaction quality, trust, and engagement. Participants rated the nodding virtual character much higher for maintaining eye contact and showing attention to what was being said. It helped enhance immersion. Participants were also more likely to approach a nodding virtual character than a non-nodding one. As for limitations, the authors suggest expanding participant demographics, refining nodding animations, and exploring VR applications in education.},
