	- Familiarizing myself with current AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) being used with people with PIMD
    - Possible uses of virtual reality for those with general communication disabilities
    - Questions: 
        - What do the current practices speech pathologists use for people with PIMD (technological or otherwise) lack?

	
	\section{10/15/2024}
	- Children/youth with S/PIMD were experienced to develop at a very slow and unpredictable pace
	- Speech language pathologists could be overeager in implementing AAC
	- VR has some limitations, despite being increasingly used in various assistive technologies
