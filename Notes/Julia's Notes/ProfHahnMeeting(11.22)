Notes from meeting with Prof. Hahn (11/22/24):
- Connecting biodata to feelings IS helpful, but we need to establish a baseline well
    - Research needs to be done at least eventually with people who have low-functioning autism but low sensory issues and sufficient regulation to wear something for a descent period of time (can’t be sensitive to EMF either)
- People with low-functioning autistic present challenges in regulating their movements and emotions, but don’t present any problems with social awareness or theory of mind
    - Theory that they have much heightened emotional and social awareness than other people
- Heart rate variability might be one of the most relevant measures
- Individuals with autism that have a heightened sensitivity to EMF are sent in “loops” when interacting with technology that emits them. It’s disabling to them.
    - That rules out wearables like watches and eye-tracking devices for this population
- Letterboard: a lot of known controversy surrounding it because people think the person holding the board is cueing them to select certain letters. Prof. Hahn says it’s definitely not true, and the reason for them holding the board is because it calms them and establishes a connection between them that is comforting and encouraging
    - Because of heightened emotional and social sensitivity, their connection to other people and their attitudes have a drastic impact from their emotional state, which in turn impacts their motor state and physical abilities
    - They also have a lot of trouble initiating and continuing actions, so things like a tap on the leg might help them go back to the task and point to letters – very very high cognitive workload
- A lot of people believe they lack emotional awareness, so one direction we could take this to is proving that they have developed a theory of mind (implicit realization of how a person feels, empathy)
    - If we do that, the public opinion of them might improve a lot
- There are groups like B.O.T.S. that focus on non speaking autistic individuals and Prof. Hahn can get us in touch with them.
    - Mouth To Hand Learning
    - Crimson Rise
- HIPPA consent isn’t going to be that hard (we can use the standard form) since they can consent through their letterboard. All we’d have to do is add a warning saying that the data we collect isn’t fully secure.
